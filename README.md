# Non Linear Regression Analysis to fit the datapoints corresponding to ChinaÂ´s GDP from 1960 to 2014


## Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

-   Differentiate between Linear and non-linear regression
-   Use Non-linear regression model in Python

If the data shows a curvy trend, then linear regression will not produce very accurate results when compared to a non-linear regression because, as the name implies, linear regression presumes that the data is linear. 
In this notebook, we fit a non-linear model to the datapoints corrensponding to China's GDP from 1960 to 2014.
